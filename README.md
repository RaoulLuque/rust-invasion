# Rust-Invaders

This is a very simple version of the game space invaders written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/). 
There is not a lot of functionality to it and the purpose of this project was getting to know the Bevy workflow and ECS as a design pattern.

## Starting the game
To start the game check the bevy setup [page](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/) for dependencies needed for compiling locally. Then it's just running

``` cargo run ``` <br>

In the project directory
